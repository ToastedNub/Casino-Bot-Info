# Beginners guide on how to progress and not continously lose

 - It's a lot easier to start with the smaller 2 probability games, as you have less of a chance to lose, and can gain enough for betting in other games with them.
 - All 2 probability games, `War`, `Higher or Lower`, `Odd or Even`, `Higher Card`, `Over or Under`, `Coin Flip`, `Red or Black`.

 - Some of the easier to win multiple probability games are `Roulette` `Guess The Number`, and `Three Card Monte`, `Rock Paper Scisors`.
